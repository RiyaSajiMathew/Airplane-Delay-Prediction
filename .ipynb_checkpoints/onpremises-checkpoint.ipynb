    "Flight delays is a very important subject for air transportation all over the world due to the financial loss this would bring. These delays not only cause inconveniences to the airlines but also to the passengers. By using Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms we can to predict if a flight will be delayed in many ways.So machine learning is an appropriate solution to deploy. Machine learning is especially important for any application that involves collecting, analyzing, and responding to large sets of data. Since we are provided a dataset that contains scheduled and actual departure and arrival times for flights between 2014 and 2018, machine learning techniques can be employed to predict flight delays.

If all these factors can be considered in our analysis, our model performance could meet the business goal perfectly. Also, different classification models can be considered and the best performing model can be used to predict delays. \n"
